{"name":"Angular Failed Requests Handler","tagline":"Angular Module to manage your failed requests","body":"Angular Failed Requests Handler\r\n===============================\r\n\r\nAngular Module to manage your failed requests.\r\n\r\nThis module is focused on **mobile development**, specially for phonegap apps (or any **HTML5 / Javascript** framework)  that you build using angular.\r\n\r\nAlthough you can use it for any web app in which you get missing server errors, or any case that suits you.\r\n\r\nThis module will help you to:\r\n* Store failed requests when mobile devices lose connection\r\n* Keep your app running as if nothing has happened and retry all your failed HTTP Requests later (when your app is loaded again)\r\n\r\nIn order to keep your app running correctly, **you should manage error cases** as them will be passed to your http requests, that is, you have to __control http error responses and keep them *hidden*__ to make believe the user everything went right and **improve the user experience** of your app. This means user won't have unwanted stops or halts using your app.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpcomming Features\r\n------------------\r\nAs this repository is focused to help manage failed requets these features are planned to be added soon:\r\n\r\n1. Management of resolving failed requests\r\n  * Resolving time (currently failed requests are retried when the app reloads).\r\n2. Filters to catch desired requests by path.\r\n3. Some other ideas that come as this project goes on...\r\n\r\nSuggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nSample\r\n------\r\n[Here](http://cyberdelphos.github.io/angular-failed-requests-handler/sample/index.html) you can see this module in action\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\nThis module requires my [key-value-storage module](https://github.com/cyberdelphos/angular-key-value-storage) in order to work. You'll need ngCookies for this module to work.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nAdd \"ngCookies\" and \"failedRequestsManager\" to your app modules list, and corresponding scripts to your HTML:\r\n```\r\nangular.module('MyApp', [ ... , 'FailedRequestsHandler', 'ngCookies' ])\r\n\r\n<script type=\"application/javascript\" src=\"lib/angular/angular-cookies.min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"application/javascript\" src=\"lib/key-value-storage/key-value-storage.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"application/javascript\" src=\"lib/failed-requests/failed-requests-handler.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\nKeyValueStorage module is added by FailedRequestsHandler module in your app definition, although, you have to add the script in your html.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nCurrently, by adding the 'failedRequestsHandler' module, all your non-read HTTP Requests which have failed will be stored. Automatically, when your app loads again, this module will retry the stored requests.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
